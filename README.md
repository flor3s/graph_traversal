# Graph Traversal
## Knight's Travails

This project creates a chess board and a knight using Ruby. It also creates a method, `knight_moves` which takes an argument consisting of two, two value arrays called `start_position` and `end_position`.

The method returns (to the console) the first found way to get from the first array (or chess board position) to the second in the least number of turns.

The project predominately tests working graph creation and traversal skills.

To see the project in action, either clone into this directory and run `knight_moves.rb` in your console, followed by `knight_moves(start_position, end_position)`, where the `start_position` and `end_position` are arrays with values between `[0,0]` and `[7,7]`
